# This is Mirror Hand!
### By: Rafael Gerkhe and Raul Leclair

Currently available prosthetics are either completely mechanical, with limited independent movement between joints, or costs thousands of dollars and require surgery to create an interface between nerves and the system. **Mirror Hand** proposes a way of improving low-cost prosthetics in cases where the user has an able hand, so that we can have it control the movements of the prosthetic. Therefore, adding functionality to the prosthetic by giving greater control over the prosthetic fingers to the user. 


### Week 1
We have started constructing the glove which will have the flex sensors that will give us the position of the able hand's fingers in order to translate them to a prosthetic. So far we have sewed the flex sensors into a glove.
